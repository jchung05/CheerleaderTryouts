# CheerleaderTryouts
A sample project for @dpmodi to demonstrate basic Angular understanding and emulate http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/

This is a no look attempt: I haven't looked at the source code for todomvc, only the example generated from  it.

Basic features I expect to work on:
  A basic text entry form that submits the entered text on 'Enter' keypress
  SPA that populates a list of submitted tasks
  Double clicking to edit existing task objects (changing the text value)
  A delete button 'X' to remove the task from the list
  Tasks can be tagged as "Active" or "Completed" and can be sorted for view that way (not complete on the given example)
